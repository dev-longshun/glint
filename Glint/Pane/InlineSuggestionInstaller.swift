import Foundation

/// Installs and removes the zsh-side inline-suggestion integration. The
/// integration is a vendored copy of `zsh-autosuggestions.zsh` (sourced from
/// `~/.config/glint/`) plus a small wrapper snippet, hooked into the user's
/// shell by appending a fenced block to `~/.zshrc`.
///
/// Why this shape:
///   - Glint can't render ghost text in SwiftUI overlays that visually match
///     ghostty's rasterization (font fallback, cell-height adjustment,
///     baseline metrics never line up perfectly). zsh-autosuggestions emits
///     the ghost as real ANSI cells, which ghostty paints with the actual
///     terminal font — so alignment is trivially exact.
///   - We considered swapping ZDOTDIR like the reverted beta.4/5 attempt
///     (commit 0503062). That broke .zprofile / .zlogin chains and confused
///     Prezto / oh-my-zsh / starship (all of which probe $ZDOTDIR for their
///     own config). Appending a tiny fenced block to the existing .zshrc
///     avoids that maintenance surface: the user's rc files keep their
///     normal resolution paths.
///   - The fenced block is idempotent (rewrites in place when found) and
///     reversible (toggle off → strip the block). Same pattern nvm /
///     rbenv / pyenv installers use. The block-management math lives in
///     `ShellRcBlock` and is shared with `ShellKeybindInstaller`.
///
/// Newly spawned zsh sessions pick this up; already-running shells keep
/// their pre-toggle behavior until they're restarted. Bash / fish panes are
/// unaffected (the block lives in .zshrc only).
///
/// Debug builds are no-ops: dev iteration of Glint-Dev must not mutate the
/// user's production `~/.zshrc` (same isolation principle as `SupportDir`
/// in `Persistence.swift`).
