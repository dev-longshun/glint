/// pre-release version ("0.1.25-beta.1"). Then:
/// - BETA users see the note for the exact pre-release they're on (each beta has

/// - STABLE users, on reaching "0.1.25", see every "0.1.25-beta.*" entry MERGED
///   into a single "0.1.25" card — the betas roll up into the version's notes.
///   So you normally DON'T author a separate stable entry; the betas are it. (If
///   a version ships without ever going through beta, author a direct stable
///   entry whose `version` is the bare base string "0.1.26".)
