/// Coalesces rapid git-status refresh requests for one workspace so a single
/// logical change can't spawn more than one `git status` subprocess.
///
/// Two independent push channels both fire for one change: the shell's
/// command-finished signal lands first, and the filesystem watcher's callback
/// follows ~0.5s later (its debounce latency). The store's in-flight gate only
/// de-dupes refreshes that overlap in time — and a fast local `git status`
/// (~100ms) finishes well before the trailing FSEvents callback arrives, so
/// one `git commit` spawned two subprocesses. This coordinator closes that gap:
/// once a refresh has been dispatched for a workspace, further refreshes
/// requested within `minInterval` coalesce into ONE trailing refresh at the
/// interval boundary. A second coalesced watcher request indicates a sustained
/// filesystem storm (build, rebase, checkout), so the trailing refresh backs
/// off to four times the base interval. The trailing refresh still always runs,
/// so a genuine change can't be dropped while the storm throttles.
///
/// Only the push-based event channels route through here. Pull-based refreshes
/// (workspace/pane switch, popover open, the active-only fallback timer) call
/// `refreshGitStatus` / `refreshGitStatusNow` directly and stay immediate.
